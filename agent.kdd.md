# TUI Companion — Key Decisions

- **Plan and Review share one gate model.** A `GateCoordinator` (`src/gate/GateCoordinator.ts`) owns
  a single one-at-a-time slot: `PlanReviewController` and `ReviewController` both `acquire()` it
  before opening any UI and release it when their gate resolves, so a plan and a review can never be
  active at once (a second request queues — its hook is already blocked on the socket — and drops out
  via the abort signal if its connection closes first). Both implement `GateSession`
  (`{kind, approve, sendFeedback}`); the shared `gate.approve` / `gate.sendFeedback` commands
  dispatch to `coordinator.current`. There is no Reject (Send Feedback covers it) and review's
  "Approve" is the old cancel path (proceed, no feedback). Inline comments are factored into a shared
  `CommentSession` (`src/comments/CommentSession.ts`) with global, controller-agnostic
  edit/save/delete commands operating on a `GateComment` (its `contextValue` flips preview↔editing to
  gate the comment menus).

- **A dropped socket connection resets gate state.** `SocketServer.handleConnection` wraps each
  blocking `plan.review.request` / `review.await.request` in an `AbortController` and aborts it on
  `socket.on("close")`; the signal threads through `BridgeHandlers` into `presentPlan` /
  `startSession`, which fulfill their gate and reset (close the plan tab, clear comments + context
  keys, restore the terminal panel, release the slot). This is the single mechanism behind "close the
  plan when ExitPlanMode completes in the agent" and "reset on any closed connection." The plan tab
  also auto-closes on a normal decision (cleared `active` first, so our own close doesn't trip the
  early-close prompt), and closing it manually while pending prompts Approve / Send Feedback. The
  bottom panel is hidden on plan open and restored on resolve. (The virtual-doc-in-search item is
  verification-driven — auto-close/reset removes lingering virtual editors; confirm in the dev host
  before adding any further suppression.)

- **Plugin TS dev scripts get their own tsconfig.** `plugins/claude-code/scripts/*.ts` (e.g. the
  bridge emulator) run directly on Node's type-stripping and live outside the extension's
  `rootDir: "src"`. They're type-checked via `plugins/claude-code/tsconfig.json` (noEmit), which
  `check-types` runs after the root build. Don't add `plugins` to the root tsconfig `include` —
  it breaks `compile-tests`' `out/` layout (the test runner globs `out/test/**`).

- **Editable diffs use the real working-tree file as the modified side.** That gives LSP + editing
  for free and routes edits to the unstaged (lowest) level. A file is editable only when it has no
  change at a lower level (committed > staged > unstaged) and isn't deleted. Tree groups are ordered
  top-down by layer (Committed, Staged, Working Tree); the unstaged group is labelled "Working Tree".

- **The `tui-review` virtual scheme is a READ-ONLY `FileSystemProvider`, not a
  `TextDocumentContentProvider`.** A content-provider doc placed on a diff's *modified* (right) side
  stays editable-in-buffer — you can type into it and Save just prompts "Save As" — so read-only diffs
  weren't actually read-only. Registering the scheme via `registerFileSystemProvider(..., {isReadonly:
  true})` (with `stat` returning `FilePermission.Readonly`) makes those docs genuinely non-editable.
  `readFile`/`stat` resolve git content (cached per-URI, cleared on change); refreshes fire
  `onDidChangeFile` Changed events. Editable diffs are unaffected: their modified side is a real
  `file://` doc, only the base side is `tui-review` (correctly read-only).

- **Editability is decided once in `openDiff`, against `this.changes`.** `file://` modified =
  editable; `tui-review` modified = read-only. This is reliable because the model is kept honest:
  `collect` uses throwing `git` for name-status and `refresh()` keeps the last-good model on git error
  (never blanks → no spurious "no changes"); the first `refresh()` runs *after* `repoService.init()`;
  `refreshSeq` discards stale results. No self-repair/reconcile pass and no `loaded` gate — those were
  scaffolding from before we found the real bug (the editable virtual scheme) and never actually fixed
  it (the failing case logged `editable=false`). Accepted edge: a restored-from-last-session editable
  tab, or a staged diff left open while its file later gains a lower-layer change, won't auto-flip to
  read-only. Diffs stay virtual (`tui-review` scheme) during a `/tui-review` session because the
  comment controller only attaches
  to that scheme — editing and commenting can't share a diff side. The first edit to a
  staged/committed editable diff (detected via `onDidChangeTextDocument` + the active
  `TabInputTextDiff`) "demotes" its base **in place**: `ReviewContentProvider` keeps a per-path
  `demoted` set and serves the index for those base sides, then fires `onDidChange` on the open base
  URI so VS Code re-renders just the left side against the live dirty buffer. No reopen/close, so no
  save prompt and caret/focus are untouched (this replaced an earlier reopen+`tabGroups.close`
  approach that prompted to save and needed `setTimeout` caret restoration). Demotions clear on a
  fresh `openDiff(path)`, on Compare-To change, and on repo switch; editable diffs are titled
  "(Working Tree)" since the base shifts. Demotions are also pruned when a diff tab closes
  (`tabGroups.onDidChangeTabs` → `pruneClosedDemotions`) — never by "no longer unstaged", which would
  wrongly un-demote a file being edited before its first save.

- **Diffs stay in sync with git via one funnel: `refresh()` always calls
  `ReviewContentProvider.refreshAllOpen()`.** The bug was that UI stage/unstage/discard refreshed the
  tree but not the open diff's virtual sides, so VS Code served a stale cached `git show :path`/`HEAD`
  blob. `refresh()` re-fires `onDidChange` for all open `tui-review` URIs (after the `refreshSeq`
  supersede guard, even when the `changesEqual` tree guard skips re-render — content can change without
  the file-list summary changing). **Do NOT add a custom `**/*` FileSystemWatcher** — an earlier one
  spawned a full `getChanges` on every working-tree event (e.g. `.vscode/settings.json` autosave
  churn) and pinned the CPU. The VS Code git extension already watches the working tree + git dir
  efficiently and fires `RepoService.onDidChange` on real status changes (working/index/HEAD,
  including external terminal `git add`/commit) — that is the sole sync trigger, wired in
  `extension.ts` to `reviewController.refresh("git")`. UI git ops also call `refresh()` directly;
  in-buffer (pre-save) edits are handled by the demotion path. `refreshSeq` discards a stale in-flight
  `getChanges`; `changesEqual` skips redundant tree renders; demotions clear on repo-root change. Set
  `tui-companion.debug` to log refresh/openDiff decisions to the "TUI Companion" channel.

- **Folder rows reuse the file stage/unstage/discard commands.** Tree folders carry their
  `FileGroup` so the contextValue is `folder:<group>`; the command handlers flatten a folder node to
  all descendant files (`filesInEntry`). Committed folders/files are read-only (no git buttons).
